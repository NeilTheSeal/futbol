# Turing Mod 1 Futbol Project README

## Check-ins
- We will communicate via Slack several times a day at least
- We will do at least one Zoom call a day

## Plan for project organization and workflow
- We have set up a [GitHub projects page](https://github.com/users/NeilTheSeal/projects/2)
- We are using [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNoUgUOE=/?share_link_id=491775417603) for whiteboarding
- Group norms are in docs/group_norms.md

## Approaches for project organization
- Git workflow - we had to decide on a naming convention for branches and how often to commit
- We wanted to try Miro because it seems more developer-friendly than Freeform
- We preferred GitHub Projects over Trello because of its integration with our repository

## Approach to code design
- What classes do we need?
  - StatTracker
    - This is the "main" class that all functionality is tied to
  - Game
    - This includes both instance methods and class methods
      - Instance methods: things like .won?
      - Class methods: for creating multiple Game instances, and calculating statistics about games
  - Team
    - Also includes instance and class methods
  - GameTeam
    - Includes instance and class methods
- How to break this out into pieces that individuals or pairs can work on?
  - Give one class responsibility to each person
  - Can do driver/navigator at the beginning of each class, and hand off tasks thereafter
  - Async: write code snippets or pseudocode in the Miro and hand that off to another person for implementation
- How do we know when something is "good enough"?
  - If it passes the spec harness tests and our unit/integration tests

## Top 3 things that went well
- Communication has been solid, both over Slack and over Zoom
- Project planning and creating a foundation was very effective
- We were all on the same page and worked well together

## 3 Things to improve on
- Ask for help when you need it
- More driver/navigator and group work
- Asking more technical questions
