# Turing Mod 1 Futbol Project README

## Check-ins
- We will communicate via Slack several times a day at least
- We will do at least one Zoom call a day

## Plan for project organization and workflow
- We have set up a [GitHub projects page](https://github.com/users/NeilTheSeal/projects/2)
- We are using [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNoUgUOE=/?share_link_id=491775417603) for whiteboarding
- Group norms are in docs/group_norms.md

## Approaches for project organization
- Git workflow - we had to decide on a naming convention for branches and how often to commit
- We wanted to try Miro because it seems more developer-friendly than Freeform
- We preferred GitHub Projects over Trello because of its integration with our repository

## Approach to code design
- What classes do we need?
  - StatTracker
    - This is the "main" class that all functionality is tied to

## Link to "Define the Relationship"
