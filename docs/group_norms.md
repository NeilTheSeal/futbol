# Group Norms - Futbol Project
## Git Workflow
- Commit every test immediately after writing
- Can commit a bad method or test, but no pull requests on failing tests or methods
- Branch naming:
  - feat/name-of-feature
  - docs/group-norms-update
  - refactor/name-of-class
- Pull requests:
  - Always leave comments, more than just a couple words
  - Big features - two people reviewing
  - Little features - one person at least
