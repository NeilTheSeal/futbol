## Overall

- Create a StatTracker class
	- Best and worst performers
	- Statistics for individual teams
	- Each method should be instance methods on StatTracker
	- Not all of the code should be in StatTracker class
- Establish norms for the group
	- Project organization process
	- Git workflow expectations
	- DTR
- Plan and design for a solution
	- Project management tool
		- GitHub Projects
- Testing:
	- "red, green, refactor"
		- Write tests
		- Make those tests pass
		- Refactor code and write additional tests as needed
	- Use fixture files (dummy data)
	- Mocks and stubs
	- Use spec harness to test functionality of a portion of the methods
